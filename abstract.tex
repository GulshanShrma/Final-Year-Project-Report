As we already know that India is the second largest most populated country in the world. In India
there is a large youth population. In this generation youths are very much fond of bikes. Because of
style and new fashion many bikers donâ€™t want to wear helmet and their fashion causes deaths which
increasing day by day. And it had been found that major deaths are because of head injuries which can
be stop by wearing helmet. More cases are about drunk and drive and it causes accidents. So to reduce
these incidents we made a smart helmet using IoT which will help us to reduce the risk of deaths and
accidents. In this there are following features if the rider wears helmet then only bike will start and if
rider is drunk then the ignition will be automatically off. The GSM Modem will send the message if any
accident occurs to the registered contact number by using sim card.
