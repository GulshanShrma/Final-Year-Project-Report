# Final-Year-Project-Report-On-Smart-Helmet-Using-IOT
This repository includes TeXstudio project files of my final year project report made in LaTeX on Smart Helmet for completion of my B.tech degree in final year (2021).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Main file for tex is document.tex.
This report can be viewed through file name document.pdf (Output of the code).
In the images folder there are images tha are used in this project.
Tex file naming research paper 1 is published in IJARESM's February 2021 Volume and can't be used by anyone else.
Many packages used in this project are not installed by default so you may have to install them manually or can be done by IDE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Code for arduino is inside folder smartHelmetCode which can be verified in Arduino IDE before transfer to chip.
